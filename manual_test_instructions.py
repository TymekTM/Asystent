üß™ MANUAL TEST INSTRUCTIONS FOR OVERLAY FIXES

1. CLIENT RUNNING CHECK:
   - Look for the GAJA icon in the system tray (usually bottom-right corner)
   - The icon should be visible and show current status when you hover over it

2. SYSTEM TRAY MENU TEST:
   - Right-click on the GAJA system tray icon
   - You should see a clean menu with only these options:
     ‚úÖ Settings
     ‚úÖ Toggle Overlay
     ‚úÖ Quit

3. SETTINGS TEST:
   - Click "Settings" from the system tray menu
   - This should open a native settings window (not a web browser)
   - The settings window should contain configuration options for GAJA

4. OVERLAY TOGGLE TEST:
   - Click "Toggle Overlay" from the system tray menu
   - The overlay should appear/disappear
   - IMPORTANT: When overlay is visible, you should still be able to click on other windows/desktop
   - The overlay should NOT block all screen clicks

5. QUIT TEST:
   - Click "Quit" from the system tray menu
   - The application should close completely
   - Check Task Manager - "gaja-overlay.exe" should NOT be running after quit
   - The system tray icon should disappear

6. OVERLAY BEHAVIOR TEST:
   - The overlay should only appear when:
     ‚úÖ Assistant is speaking
     ‚úÖ User is talking after wake word
     ‚úÖ Manually toggled via system tray
   - The overlay should NOT appear all the time
   - The overlay should NOT block clicks when visible

üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Clean system tray menu
- Settings open in native window
- Overlay toggles without blocking clicks
- Quit closes everything properly
- No "stuck" overlay processes

üö® PROBLEMS TO REPORT:
- Settings open in web browser instead of native window
- Overlay blocks all screen clicks
- Quit leaves overlay process running
- Too many menu items in system tray
- Overlay appears constantly instead of only when needed

üìù NOTES:
- The overlay is built with Tauri (Rust) for native performance
- Settings should be a native window, not a web page
- System tray integration should be seamless
- All processes should close cleanly

üîß Current Status: Testing implementation...
