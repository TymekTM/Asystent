- Automated and scheduled unit/integration tests (run from UI, view results/history)
- Multi-modal input support (text, voice, file/image upload in web UI)
- Improved long-term memory (search, tagging, context linking, memory management)
- Accessibility improvements (screen reader support, keyboard navigation, color contrast)
- Documentation and onboarding (user guide, developer setup, API docs)
- API integrations: add more external services (weather, calendar, IoT, etc.)
- Security review and improvements (rate limiting, audit logs, config secrets)
- Internationalization (multi-language UI, easy translation)
- Mobile-friendly/responsive UI improvements
