# Voice Interaction Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions on using Asystent's voice interaction capabilities.

## Wake Word Detection

Asystent can be activated by speaking its wake word:

1. **Default Wake Word**: The default wake word is "asystent" (pronounced in Polish)
2. **Customization**: You can change the wake word in the Configuration page
3. **Activation**: When the wake word is detected, the system will play a sound and begin listening for your command

## Voice Commands

Asystent understands natural language commands across various domains. Here are examples of implemented command types:

### General Information
- "What time is it?"
- "What's the weather like today?"
- "Tell me about [topic]"

### System Commands
- "Take a screenshot"
- "Search for [query]"
- "Remember this information"

### Memory Commands
- **Adding memories**: "Remember that [information]"
- **Retrieving memories**: "What do you remember about [topic]?"
- **Deleting memories**: "Forget about [specific memory]"

### Using Plugins
- **Search**: "Search for recent news about artificial intelligence"
- **Deep reasoning**: "Think deeply about [complex topic]"
- **Screen analysis**: "What's on my screen right now?"
- **API queries**: "What's the weather in Warsaw?"

## Voice Settings

You can customize the voice interaction experience through the Configuration page:

### Microphone Selection
1. Go to the Configuration page
2. Find the "Microphone Device" dropdown
3. Select your preferred microphone
4. Save configuration

### Voice Recognition Model
Asystent currently supports two voice recognition systems:

- **Vosk**: Offline, lightweight recognition
- **Whisper**: Higher accuracy but may require more resources

To configure:
1. Go to Configuration
2. Toggle "Use Whisper for Command" based on your preference
3. Select Whisper model type if applicable
4. Save configuration

### Silence Threshold
You can adjust how quickly the system determines you've finished speaking:

1. Go to Configuration
2. Find "STT Silence Threshold"
3. Adjust the value (lower values make the system more sensitive)
4. Save configuration

## Manual Activation

If you prefer not to use the wake word, you can activate the assistant manually:

1. On the Dashboard or Chat page, click the "Activate Manually" button
2. Speak your command when you hear the activation sound
3. The system will process your command just as if you had used the wake word

## Troubleshooting Voice Issues

### Wake Word Not Detected
- Ensure your microphone is properly connected and selected
- Speak clearly and at a moderate volume
- Try adjusting your microphone position
- Check that the wake word is correctly configured

### Poor Voice Recognition
- Try using a different STT model (Whisper may be more accurate than Vosk)
- Reduce background noise
- Speak more slowly and clearly
- Check microphone quality and positioning

### No Audio Response
- Verify your speakers are connected and volume is up
- Check the logs for TTS errors
- Restart the assistant if needed
- Confirm ffplay is properly installed (required for audio playback)
