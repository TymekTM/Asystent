# Security Audit Fixes - Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the GAJA Assistant codebase.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Password Security Issues

#### Issue: Plaintext Password Storage
- **File**: `database_models.py`
- **Problem**: User passwords were stored in plaintext in the database
- **Fix**: 
  - Added secure password hashing using PBKDF2 with SHA-256
  - Added salt column to users table for additional security
  - Implemented password verification functions
  - Added database migration for existing users
  - Added secure password update functionality

#### Issue: Default Admin Password
- **File**: `auth_system.py`
- **Problem**: Hard-coded default admin password "admin123"
- **Fix**:
  - Generate secure random password (128-bit entropy)
  - Display password once during creation with prominent warnings
  - Save credentials to protected file (600 permissions)
  - Log critical warnings about password security

### 2. Path Traversal Vulnerability

#### Issue: Unsafe Plugin Loading
- **File**: `server/server_main.py`
- **Problem**: Plugin names used directly in file paths without validation
- **Fix**:
  - Added input validation for plugin names (alphanumeric + underscore/hyphen only)
  - Prevented path traversal sequences (../, \, etc.)
  - Used secure path construction with Path.resolve()
  - Verified plugin files are within expected directory
  - Added file size limits to prevent DoS attacks
  - Enhanced error logging for security events

### 3. External Command Execution Security

#### Issue: Unsafe ffplay Execution
- **Files**: 
  - `audio_modules/beep_sounds.py`
  - `client/audio_modules/beep_sounds.py`
  - `audio_modules/tts_module.py`
  - `client/audio_modules/tts_module.py`
  - `audio_modules/enhanced_tts_module.py`
- **Problem**: External ffplay command executed without proper validation
- **Fixes**:
  - Added ffplay binary validation (check PATH and verify it's actually ffplay)
  - Added audio file path validation (extension, size, location checks)
  - Secured subprocess execution with:
    - `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL` (prevent input injection)
    - `stdout/stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL` (prevent information leakage)
    - `start_new_session=True` (prevent signal propagation)
  - Added file size limits (50MB max) to prevent DoS attacks
  - Restricted allowed audio file extensions

## Security Enhancements Added

### Password Security Functions
```python
def _hash_password(password: str, salt: str = None) -> tuple[str, str]
def _verify_password(password: str, stored_hash: str, salt: str) -> bool
def verify_user_password(username: str, password: str) -> bool
def update_user_password(username: str, new_password: str) -> bool
```

### Input Validation Functions
```python
def _validate_ffplay_available() -> bool
def _validate_audio_file_path(file_path: str) -> bool
```

### Plugin Loading Security
- Plugin name validation with regex patterns
- Path traversal prevention
- File system boundary enforcement
- File size limitations

## Database Schema Changes

### Users Table
Added `salt` column for secure password storage:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN salt TEXT;
```

### Migration Strategy
- Existing users without salt will be prompted to reset passwords
- New users automatically get secure password hashing
- Backward compatibility maintained during transition

## Configuration Security

### Admin Account Creation
- Secure random password generation (16 characters, URL-safe base64)
- One-time password display with critical warnings
- Protected credential file creation (600 permissions)
- Enhanced logging for security events

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Password Security Testing**
   - Verify all new passwords are properly hashed
   - Test password verification functionality
   - Confirm migration works for existing users

2. **Path Traversal Testing**
   - Attempt to load plugins with malicious names
   - Verify rejection of "../" sequences
   - Test boundary enforcement

3. **External Command Testing**
   - Test ffplay validation with missing binary
   - Verify file extension restrictions
   - Test file size limitations

## Future Security Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting for authentication attempts
2. **Session Security**: Implement secure session management
3. **Audit Logging**: Add comprehensive security event logging
4. **Input Sanitization**: Review all user input handling
5. **Dependency Security**: Regular security updates for dependencies

## Compliance Notes

These fixes address common security vulnerabilities including:
- CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials
- CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory
- CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command
- CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements

The implemented fixes follow OWASP security guidelines and industry best practices for secure application development.
